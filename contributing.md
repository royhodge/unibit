UniBit is an Open Source project and we welcome contributions of all sorts.

There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, contributing code, and
helping us improve our community.

### Community Guidelines

We want to keep the UniBit community awesome, growing and collaborative.  
To help with this we've come up with some general guidelines for the community as a whole:

- Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. 
(No abuse will be tolerated.) 

- Encourage diversity and participation: 
(Make everyone in our community feel welcome, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.)

- Keep it legal: Basically, don't get anybody in trouble. 
(Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break laws.)

- Stay on topic: 
(Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions.)

There is also a more extensive [code-of-conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Getting Started

If you're curious to hack on UniBit right now and you just need an issue to focus on, check out 
[this search](https://github.com/search?=Issues) for issues tagged as "help wanted". 
Generally, these should be easier for newcomers, and are great places to start hacking away. 
Have fun!

### Reporting Issues

If you find bugs, mistakes, inconsistencies in the UniBit project's code or documents, 
please let us know by filing an issue at the appropriate issue tracker (we use multiple repositories). 
No issue is too small.

The main issues for bug reporting are as follows:
- [Windows/issues](https://github.com/unibitlabs/windows/issues) - Issues related to the Windows implementation of UniBit.
- [Mac/issues](https://github.com/unibitlabs/mac/issues) - Issues related to running the Mac implementation of UniBit.
- [support/issues](https://github.com/unibitlabs/support/issues) - If you're not sure but you need support on running UniBit.
- [notes/issues](https://github.com/unibitlabs/notes/issues) - For general notes and ideas.
- [faq/issues](https://github.com/unibitlabs/faq/issues) - For questions.


### Security Issues

The UniBit protocol and its implementations are still in heavy development. 
This means that there may be problems in our protocols, or there may be mistakes in our implementations. 
And -- though UniBit is not production-ready yet -- many people are already running nodes in their machines. 
So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously. 
If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments 
-- for example, expose a remote execution exploit --
please send your report privately to [security@unibit.io], please DO NOT file a public issue. 
The GPG key for security@unibit.io is 
[KEY GOES HERE](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=KEY).

If the issue is a protocol weakness or something not yet deployed, just discuss it openly.

### Contribution Guidelines

Please see [contribution-guidelines.md](contribution-guidelines.md).

### Community Improvement

The UniBit community requires maintenance of various "public infrastructure" resources. 
These include documentation, github repositories, and more. 
There is also helping new users with questions, spreading the word about UniBit, and so on. 
Soon, we will be planning and running conferences. Please get in touch if you would like to help out.

### Translations

This community moves very fast, and documentation swiftly gets out of date. 
For now, we are encouraging would-be translators to hold off from translating large repositories. 
For some repositories, this is OK  - for instance, on the [example](https://github.com/unibit/example). 
If you would like to add a translation, please open an issue and ask the leads for a given repository before filing a PR, 
so that we do not waste efforts.

If anyone has any issues understanding the English documentation, please let us know! 
If you would like to do so privately, please email @yoshi. 
We are very sensitive to language issues, and do not want to turn anyone away from hacking because of their language.

### Helping in other ways

UniBit Labs occasionally is able to hire developers for part time or full time positions, to work on UniBit. 
If you are interested, check out [the job listings](http://). 
If you'd like to help in other ways, email @js_ directly(mailto:js_@unibit.io?subject=Contributing to UniBit).
