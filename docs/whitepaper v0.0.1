                              (UNIBIT) Technical Whitepaper v0.0.1
                                "a rising tide lifts all ships"
                                
     UNIBIT is a framework to build Decentralized Applications on top of, and to enable a micro-transactional economical model.
     We intend to deploy this on a Private Blockchain utilizing MultiChain's technology and to integrate IPFS as well.
     
     With these (UN) Unique Nodes running our UNIBIT framework on them, users will be able to atomically transact across multiple
     chains instantly with which protocol we further support. We are currently awaiting COMIT* to release their Cross Chain Routing Protocol;
     in the meantime, we have developed our own in-house protocols utilizing libp2p from Proton Labs we were able to further develop our
     (UN) to an even more customizable adoption of the IPFS MainNet nodes combined with our UNIBIT Blockchain Seed Nodes;
     
      The UNIBIT blockchain is one thing. A decentralized autonomous network of peers watching a ledger that is private.
      
     This private ledger allows us to utilize streams,metadata encoding, and a plethora of other features, such as permission's,
     mining privileges, and admin-consensus restraint parameters. 
     
     UniBit is a cross-chain platform that allows for atomic transactions while enhancing Dapp development & enableling a micro-transaction
     economy. Can List in bullet form pro's of multichain, pro's of ipfs, how we integrated both those into our unique node configuration.
